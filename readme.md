# üìò Project README: Automated Review Tool for Project Management Documentation

## üß† Overview

This project aims to develop a solution that **automatically reviews and analyzes project management-related content** extracted from various documents‚Äîsuch as proposals, plans, contracts, and reports. The system will:

* Identify  **contradictions** ,  **inconsistencies** , and **ambiguous language**
* Suggest **clearer, more consistent alternatives**
* Improve  **communication alignment** ,  **documentation quality** , and **compliance**

Technologies used include  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** ,  **Machine Learning** , and  **Rule-Based Techniques** .

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud System Requirements

* **Azure OpenAI Configuration** :
* Data privacy settings enabled
* Data retention disabled (queries/responses not stored or used for model training)
* **Security Review** :
* All datasets must be reviewed by the project sponsor before distribution
* Data sharing must follow established cybersecurity protocols
* **Verification** :
* Azure subscription configuration file or written confirmation from the subscription owner verifying prompt storage and retention are disabled

## üéØ Project Scope & Objectives

### Objective

Partner with **MCBC** to develop a tool that:

* Reviews project management documents
* Detects contradictory or unclear language
* Ensures consistency
* Suggests improvements for clearer communication

### Requirements

* Use Azure OpenAI subscription managed by **i.c.stars** with **MCBC** data/documents
* Automatically identify contradictions and inconsistencies:
  * Within a single document
  * Across multiple documents in the same project
* Detect ambiguous language related to project management
* Suggest clearer, consistent wording
* Provide explanations for flagged content
* Offer contextual suggestions based on industry standards
* Enable document comparison by criteria (timeline, scope, roles, deliverables)
* Support custom rule creation
* Track and log changes for auditing/version control
* Integrate with common document formats (.docx, .pdf, .txt) and cloud platforms
